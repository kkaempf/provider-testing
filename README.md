About
-----

This is a full testsuite for (the Ruby part of) cmpi-bindings.


Requirements
------------

Ruby (1.8 or 1.9), rake, sblim-sfcb, sblim-sfcc and sfcc.gem (from rubygems.org)


Invocation
----------

Run

  rake

to run all test cases.

This will spawn a local sfcbd listening at port 12345, point it to the
Ruby cmpi provider from build/swig/ruby, load Ruby class provider from
test/rake/samples/providers and execute the tests from
test/rake/test_*.rb


Issues
------

The testsuite currently fails to stop sfcbd after running all tests.
